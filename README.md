Little MRT
==========

### Overview

This is the graph that represents a railroad in a little town. All of the tracks are 'one-way.'  That is, a route from **A** to **B** does not imply the existence of a route from **B** to **A**.  In fact, even if both of these routes do happen to exist, they are distinct and are not necessarily the same distance.

For example, in the graph below, there is a route from **A** to **B**, but there is no route from **B** to **A**. There is also a route from **C** to **D** and vice versa. The number next to line indicate the distance between stations.
